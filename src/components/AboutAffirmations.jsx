            This app uses localStorage to save your affirmations. If that means
            nothing to you here is what you need to know. Your affirmations are
            stored in your web browser (as opposed to a database) so if you keep
            using this device and this browser you will always see your
            affirmations. This means you will only have access to your personal
            affirmations specifically on this device and broswer.
